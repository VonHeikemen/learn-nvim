# Introduction

Welcome to this very unofficial site dedicated to Neovim.

The purpose of this site is to teach you how to use Neovim like a text editor.

You will learn how to install Neovim's latest stable version. How to use the `nvim` command in the terminal. And how to work with multiple files without adding any extra configuration or installing third-party plugins.

On the customization side you will learn the basic functions and commands to make a simple configuration.
